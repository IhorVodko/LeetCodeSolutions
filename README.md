<h1>LeetCode Solutions</h1>

<p>Welcome! This repository contains <strong>efficient solutions to <a href="https://leetcode.com/u/CyberArtist/">LeetCode problems</a></strong>, written in modern, readable, and self-explanatory code.</p>

<p>C++ is the primary programming language used. For educational purposes, STL algorithms and/or data structures may sometimes be omitted in easy-level problems to illustrate concepts clearly.</p>

<p>Database-related problems are solved using <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, and shell-related problems are solved using <strong>Bash</strong>. All solutions aim for <strong>optimal runtime complexity</strong>, and most of them achieve <strong>top runtime performance</strong>, often beating 100% of submissions.</p>

<h2>What each solution file includes</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Time complexity analysis</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Space complexity analysis</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Runtime performance comparison</strong> with other solutions in the same language</li>
  <li><strong>Link to the LeetCode submission</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Link to the solution post</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Link to the original LeetCode problem</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>⚠️ Memory performance comparisons are not included, as LeetCode does not provide accurate measurements for this metric. Please refer to the space complexity analysis instead.</em></p>
