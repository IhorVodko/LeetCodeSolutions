# LeetCode Solutions
Here you can find efficient solutions to [LeetCode problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/) using modern readable and self-explained code. C++ is a main programming language used to solve the problems. Sometimes STL algorithms and/or data structures are not used for easy level problems for educational purposes. PostgreSQL dialect is used to solve database-related problems. Bash is used to solve shell-related problems. Most of the solutions beats 100% mark, based on runtime performance.

At each solution file could be found:
<ul>
  <li>time complexity analysis</li>
  <li>space comlexity analysis</li>
  <li>runtime performance copmared to other solutions using the same language</li>
  <li>link to a leetCode solution's submission</li>
  <li>link to a leetCode sulution's post</li>
  <li>link to a leetCode problem</li>
</ul>
Memory performance compared to other solutions is not indicated because this metric is not accurately measured by LeetCode, so refer to above-mentioned space comlexity analysis instead.<br>
